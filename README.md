# pb-cle.org
[pb-cle.org](https://pb-cle.org) is a social media website for a local electronic dance music community (pittsburgh - cleveland). Post events, comment on photos, and upload flyers.

This has been one of the larger projects I have built.

## Goals
- Too many ads on social media nowadays, so wanted to move away from major social media sites.
- Create reddit like system for posts.
- Create events system like facebook events.
- Create profile pages like facebook.

The site is built using [Laravel](https://laravel.com) with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com). I wanted to build something with some react-ability, resembling a reddit like system. I also wanted to challenge myself.
